Introduction        {#intro}
============

A measurement node (MEAS) measures single-photon states received from
an optical Channel.

MEAS QEndNode type definition
=====================

A MEAS node measures single-photon states sent to it.  It MUST be able
to measure in at least two bases, X and Z, either directly or by
applying a single-qubit gate before measurement.  It SHOULD be able to
switch between measurement bases on a per-measurement basis.  Basis
selection may be either passive, or under software/hardware control.

Successful measurement of the photon MAY be probabilistic, and most
likely will be low probability, when incorporating channel loss,
coupling loss, and detector efficiency.  Control systems and protocols
MUST be prepared for MEAS nodes to be probabilistic.

The measurement operation MAY be noisy, i.e. error-prone; this is the
expected case.  Link or device characterization processes such as
tomography will be used as part of network monitoring.  This
information MAY be used by network monitoring systems to declare a
link operational or non-operational, and MAY be used by a Responder to
plan RuleSets.
