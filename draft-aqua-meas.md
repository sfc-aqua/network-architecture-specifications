Introduction        {#intro}
============

A measurement node (MEAS) measures single-photon states received from
an optical Channel.

MEAS QEndNode type definition
=====================

A MEAS node is a type of QEndNode, a quantum network end node.

A MEAS node measures single-photon states sent to it.  It MUST be able
to measure in at least two bases, X and Z, either directly or by
applying a single-qubit gate before measurement.  It SHOULD be able to
switch between measurement bases on a per-measurement basis.  Basis
selection may be either passive, or under software/hardware control.

Successful measurement of the photon MAY be probabilistic, and most
likely will be low probability, when incorporating channel loss,
coupling loss, and detector efficiency.  Control systems and protocols
MUST be prepared for MEAS nodes to be probabilistic.

The measurement operation MAY be noisy, i.e. error-prone; this is the
expected case.  Link or device characterization processes such as
tomography will be used as part of network monitoring.  This
information MAY be used by network monitoring systems to declare a
link operational or non-operational, and MAY be used by a Responder to
plan RuleSets.

A MEAS MAY consist of more than one physical photon detector treated
as a single unit, in order to detect two eigenstates of the same
measurement basis or to measure in two bases.

Node Requirements
-----

A MEAS node conforms to the following specifications:

* Quantum Network Architecture [](#QNA)
* Quantum Connection Setup Protocol [](#I-D.setup)
* Quantum Rule Operations Protocol

Photonic Qubit Representations
-----

A MEAS node is designed to work with a particular representation of a
qubit.  The deployed optical path MUST either share a single photonic
qubit representation, or include representation conversion to allow
interoperation.  This choice is made at network hardware selection and
deployment time, and is not under software control.  This
specification supports the following photonic qubit representations:

* polarization: by convention, the two single-qubit states are known
  as horizontal and vertical polarization, written |H> and |V>.
* time bin:  by convention, the two single-qubit states are known
  as early and late, written |E> and |L>.

Active v. Passive Basis Selection
-----

Depending on the implementation of the quantum plane of the MEAS node,
the measurement basis for individual operations MAY be either Active,
under hardware and software control, or Passive, selected at random by
a physical process such as the use of a beam splitter.

For entangled photon pairs where both photons are being measured at
independent MEAS nodes, the two nodes MAY differ in this respect.  One
node may be Passive and the other Active.

Quantum Physical Layer
=====

The quantum physical layer, including parameters such as wavelength,
channel type and loss, jitter in classical synchronization signals,
etc. are beyond the scope of this document.  The following parameters
and functions serve as the interface to the physical layer:

* TBD

Detection Events, WavePackets and TimingWindows
=====

This document refers to "single photon", but a more accurate term is
"wave packet".  A wave packet is the probability amplitude of the
photon over a period of time.  The photon is localized in time and
space when it is measured; that is, when the detector clicks.

A wave packet has an envelope.  This envelope may be any shape, but in
this architecture a WavePacket is defined to have a square shape of a
defined duration.

A single-photon detector MUST register a click only when the detector
is enabled.  A detector MAY click due to "dark counts", spontaneous
events that are not triggered by the absorption of a photon but are
otherwise indistinguishable from correct detection of a photon.  Dark
counts result in lowered fidelity of a sequence of measurements
reported to other nodes or subsystems within the network.

To correctly detect a photon, the detector(s) must also be physically
prepared to detect photons (e.g., it is recovered from any prior
detection operation).

The combination of these factors determines the probability of
photon detection and the probability of dark counts.  Ideally, the
detector will be enabled for a long time in order to maximize the
overlap with the WavePacket and maximize the probability of
detection.  However, the probability of a dark count is linear in the
amount of time that the detector is enabled, so it is desirable to
minimize the length of the enabled period.  This tradeoff SHOULD be
under software control, via the setting of node parameters
([](#params)).

PHY Synchronization
=====

Synchronization of MEAS involves two major tasks:

* coordinating the enabling and disabling of the physical detector
  with the chosen DetectionWindow such that it overlaps with the
  WavePacket
* identifying the WavePacketTrain and the WavePacket such that events
  are properly identified and reported to local software and/or the
  photon transmitting nodes

Timing Negotiation
=====

MEAS nodes MUST negotiate timing of the arrival of photons with nodes
that transmit the photons to be measured.

Parameters        {#params}
======

Fixed
-----

The following parameters are implicit in the type of hardware selected
and deployed.

* QubitRepresentation
* Wavelength
* Accepted WavePacket format
* PassiveActiveBasis

Configured
-----

* *Minimum inter-photon interval* (MIPI): the minimum time between two
  consecutive photon WavePackets in a WavePacketTrain.  Units are in
  nanoseconds.  Specified as a floating point number.
* Maximum WavePacketTrain length: the maximum number of WavePackets in
  a single train.
* Minimum inter-train interval: the minimum time between the end of
  one WavePacketTrain, including the outer limits of the WavePacket
  for the last photon, and the arrival of the Sync signal for the next
  WavePacketTrain.
* PhySyncOffset: the interval between the arrival of the physical
  synchronization signal and the start of the first detector window.
  Units are in nanoseconds.  Specified as a floating point number.

Measured/Monitored
-----

* XMeasurementDroppedQubit
* ZMeasurementDroppedQubit
* XMeasurementDarkCount
* ZMeasurementDarkCount
* XasZMeasurementError
* ZasXMeasurementError

Quantum Rule Operations Protocol Messages
=====

Messages sent and received by MEAS nodes conform to the
Quantum Rule Operations Protocol (QROP) specification.

Transmitted
-----

A MEAS sends the following QROP messages:

* MeasurementResults

Received
----

A MEAS receives the following QROP messages:

* MeasurementResults

Participation in Network Monitoring
=====

A MEAS node MUST cooperate with nodes that transmit photons in order
to execute link characterization and monitoring.

Link monitoring messages are exchanged as application-level messages,
originated by the HardwareMonitor module of the QRSA [](QNA).

Integration with Applications
=====

Because a MEAS is a QEndNode, applications running on classical
systems may request quantum communication services from the node.

These interfaces and applications are to be developed with the Sasaki,
Satoh and Soeda groups.

Example Deployments
=====

Unswitched MEAS-EPPS-MEAS Link
-----

Except for a single source and MEAS, this is the most basic
configuration.  Timing in the path is selected to match the worst
performance of the three nodes.

Switched MEAS-OSW-EPPS-MEAS
-----

In a switched configuration, both timing and addressing/demultiplexing
of messages are critical.

Optical Entanglement Swapping MEAS-EPPS-BSA-EPPS-MEAS
-----

In a MEAS-EPPS-BSA-EPPS-MEAS path, the timing must be driven by the
BSA node, in order to achieve appropriate synchronization of the
arrival of overlapping photons.
