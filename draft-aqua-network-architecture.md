--- abstract

A RuleSet-based quantum network architecture is described.

This architecture document does not cover internetworking, but is
internetworking-ready.

The common use case for this network is the creation of Bell pairs,
bipartite states with one qubit at one EndNode and one qubit and
another EndNode.  The architecture, but not necessarily the initial
instances of all underlying protocols, supports multi-partite states
shared among more than two nodes.

Rules and RuleSets
==================

Rules determine the actions to be executed on one or more quantum
states by quantum network nodes.  Each Rule has a Condition Clause and
an Action Clause. Rules are collected into RuleSets.  At a Node, each
connection is governed by a RuleSet.

A DistRuleSet is the set of all RuleSets governing the operation of a
connection, at all nodes.

The detailed syntax and semantics of Rules and RuleSets are out of
scope for this document.  See {{cocori-ms-thesis}}.

Naming and identifiers

Channels and links

Connection identifiers

Rule identifiers
----------------

A RuleID identifies a specific Rule within a RuleSet.

The scope for a RuleID is the DistRuleSet.


RuleSet identifiers
-------------------

A RuleSetID identifies a specific RuleSet.

The scope of the RuleSetID is...

Quantum state tags
------------------

Quantum network nodes build end-to-end shared quantum states to
delivered to applications, by using partial quantum states.  Nodes
exchange messages to facilitate this process.  Every quantum state
that is operated on based on the contents of a message received from
some partner, therefore, MUST have a TAG that can be referred to,
serving as the name for the state.

The TAG MUST be unique within a defined scope.  A state instantiated
locally as one or more qubits belongs to a RULE. The scope for the tag
is the RULE.

The contents of the TAG MAY be opaque to partner nodes, but a
receiving Node MUST be able to map the TAG to the physical qubit or
qubits currently holding the state.

A TAG MAY be a simple sequence number, provided that sequence numbers
are unique and are not reused over the lifetime of the Connection.

Node type definitions
=====================

The first architecture concerns only four types of Nodes, described
below.  Eight more types of nodes have been defined in the research
literature and will be incorporated in future specifications
{{rdv-qce-arch}}.

Quantum Router Software Architecture (QRSA)
===========================================

See Document 501 for an overview. To be adapted from existing QuISP documentation.

This document specifies node requirements in terms of externally
visible functionality, rather than mandating an implementation.  The
Quantum Router Software Architecture (QRSA) is the name of a reference
software implementation that conforms to this behavioral
specification, particularly the common node requirements described in
{{node-req}}.

Subsets of the QRSA functionality are implemented in dfferent ways for
different node types.  Not all node types are required to implement
all functions.

Timing regimes
==============

The detailed operation of the interconnect at both the link and network levels involves hardware and software signals and events across many orders of magnitude difference in required latency. Some of the timing regimes are:

* interferometric stabilization: need for sub-wavelength stability is photonic qubit representation-dependent
* photon wave packet overlap: technology-dependent photon wave packet length, but roughly nanoseconds
* opening and closing of detector timing windows, detector recovery time: nanoseconds to microseconds
* measurement basis selection (if required in BSA): performance will constrain entanglement attempt rate
* optical switch control: switching of trains of wave packets, performance will constrain multiplexing and entanglement attempt rate
* pre-configured event-driven tasks such as timing-triggered or measurement-triggered execution of quantum circuits: microseconds
* urgent but not synchronous-critical tasks (e.g., execution of classical code that processes RuleSet messages and selects or creates new quantum circuits for execution): microseconds
* host-side application-level tasks (e.g. post-measurement operations): milliseconds
* background tasks (link tomography calculations, routing table updates): seconds to minutes

Some of these can only be achieved using high-quality hardware, while others are software tasks. Detailed analysis of these regimes will affect core software design in each network node type.
