Connection setup and teardown (common portions)
White Rabbit absolute and relative clock synchronization
Timing regimes: See 様式501 for an overview. To be developed in conjunction with hardware and software members of the Nagayama Project.
Quantum Router Software Architecture (QRSA): See 様式501 for an overview. To be adapted from existing QuISP documentation.
n.b.: no nodes in this demonstration network are actually routers; QRSA is simply the name of the software suite. Subsets of the QRSA functionality are implemented in dfferent ways for different node types.
